    "Some configurations can be turned on to debug the simulator. As a result, you can get more console output from the simulation and visualizations such as coordinates and physics to help develop features or fix bugs. To receive debug messages, set `debug=True` in the config when creating the environment. In debug mode, the `log_level` will be changed to `logging.DEBUG`, so you will get more information from MetaUrban, Panda3D, and RenderPipeline in the console."

    "It is important to make sure that physics world is accurate. For example, objects should have accurate bounding boxes in order to ensure the collision detection is correct. Specifying `debug=True` in environment config can turn on the debug mode. In this mode, you can visualize the physics world by pressing `1` (the one near `~`) on your keyboard. In the following example, we have automatically turned on the physics world visualizer for you by `env.engine.toggleDebug()`. Pressing `1` can turn if off."
