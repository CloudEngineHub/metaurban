Welcome to the MetaUrban documentation!
.. MetaDrive is an efficient and compositional driving simulator with the following key features:

.. * Compositional: It supports generating infinite scenes with various road maps and traffic settings for the research of generalizable RL.
.. * Lightweight: It is easy to install and run. It can run up to 1,500 FPS on a standard PC.
.. * Realistic: Accurate physics simulation and multiple sensory input including Lidar, RGB images, top-down semantic map and first-person view images.


This documentation brings you the information on installation, usages and more of MetaUrban!
